# Hack
A prank tool for hacking

This script can simulate hacking or a hacking scene used in the movies. It can also be used for pranking others!

This script can only run on Linux.

To run this script, you'll need to have XTerm installed on your system, or some of the functionalities won't work. Before you run this script, make sure you run `alias hack="bash <ScriptLocation>/Hack.sh"`. To run this, you have to run this command:

```hack <Anything>```

where  `<Anything>` could be anything. It's recommended to put an IP address or a URL there.

You can also run it by only executing it or running the `hack` command only.

Good Luck!
