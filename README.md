# Hack
A prank tool for hacking

This script can simulate hacking or a hacking scene used in the movies. It can also be used for pranking others!

This script can only run on Linux.

To run this script, you'll need to have XTerm installed on your system, or some of the functionalities won't work. Before you run this script, make sure you run `alias hack="bash Hack.sh"`. To run this, first open a terminal where this script is. Then run this script:

```hack <anything>```

where  `<anything>` could be anything. It's recommended to put an IP address there.

Good Luck!
